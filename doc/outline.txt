section 0 (intro)
section 1 (method)
    subsection 1  
        write down models (pca for training and study sets)
    subsection 2 (describe each method)
        simple proj
        trace
        hdpca
        online
            randomized (for ref)
                reduce memory and computation time
    subsection 3
        simulation studies 
        describe ggs
        explain parameters being changed (mig, #snps, #ref sample)
        explain real dataset (HDPG, 1000genome)
section 2 (results)
    describe simulation studies
        computation time
            show plots and figures
            fix nTest, change nTrain
            fix nTrain, change nTest
                can cut off and use projected runtimes  
        accuracy
            compare test results to ref centers
            compare trace and other methods
section 4 (discussion)


increase n for fixed m varying n plot to reduce noise
